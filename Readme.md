# nRF51-VsCode-Samples

This repo contains some sample projects for the nRF51 series adapted for Visual Studio Code.

Sample projects have been taken from [examples given by Nordic Semiconductor for the SDK v12.3.0](http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/com.nordic.infocenter.sdk5.v12.3.0/examples.html?cp=4_0_7_4), the last compatible version with the nRF51 series.

These projects are using the [Cortex Debug VsCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marus25.cortex-debug) for debugging

# Installation
Coming soon, no time to write this part right now. 
Sorry

# Thanks

These sample VsCode projects are based on the [VSC-Nordic-example repository](https://github.com/gera-k/VSC-Nordic-example), the diference is that mine is using Cortex Debug.

Many thanks to Gera Kazakov who nicely shared is work and greatly helped me putting all the pieces together.
